# Professional support / sponsorship
Is your business relying on this program to secure customer websites and perhaps even critical 
infrastructure? Then maybe it would be good for your peace of mind then to sponsor one of its 
core developers, to gain guaranteed future support and good karma at the same time. I offer my 
help quickly, discreetly and professionally via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/woutertinus).

# Donations
Do you like the program and want to buy me a beer and discuss the future of the program in 
private? My [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/woutertinus) also has some affordable 
"Thank you" tiers.
